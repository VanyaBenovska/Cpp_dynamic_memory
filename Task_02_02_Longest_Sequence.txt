Longest Sequence
Write a program that finds the longest sequence of equal elements in an integer array and then prints that sequence
on the console (integers separated by space on a single line). If there is more than one such sequence, print the last
one. The input array will be entered on two lines – the first line will contain an integer representing the number of
elements, the second will contain the elements separated by spaces
