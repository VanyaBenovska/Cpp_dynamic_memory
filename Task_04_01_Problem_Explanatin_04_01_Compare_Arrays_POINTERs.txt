Problem 04_01 – Compare Arrays
Write a program that reads two integer arrays from the console and compares them element by element. For better code reusability, you could do the comparison in a function, which returns true if they are equal and false if not.
Each array will be defined by a single line on the console, containing the numbers in the array, separated by spaces.
Print equal if the arrays match, and not equal if the arrays don’t match.

Examples

1 2 3
1 2 3
Output:	equal

1 2 3
2 1 3
Output:	not equal

10 1
42 13 69
Output:	not equal
